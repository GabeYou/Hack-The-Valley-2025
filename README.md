## Inspiration

We were inspired by Earth Day events, where students often participate in walks to clean up trash from roads and parks. We wanted to capture the same spirit of community action and make it easier for anyone to contribute to local good causes while also creating rewards & incentives.


## What it does

EcoBounty is a platform where people can crowd-fund community-based tasks. Think of it as a GoFundMe, but specifically for actionable, local projects that make a positive impact. Users can create campaigns for initiatives such as:
- Cleaning up trash in parks or streets
- Planting trees or community gardens
- Helping find missing pets

## How we built it

We built EcoBounty using React, Material-UI and TailwindCSS for the front-end. We used Node.js and Prisma ORM for database management and Supabase for PostgreSQL database hosting. We also used a JWT-based system to authenticate user requests.


## Challenges we ran into

Initially, we started building the UI with TailwindCSS and developed some components and pages. However, we later realized that Material UI (MUI) would be easier to use. This meant we had to remake some components and pages in MUI, which was time-consuming.
